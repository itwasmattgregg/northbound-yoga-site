      <p>Welcome to Northbound Yoga!</p>
      <p>
        Yoga is the integration of our body, mind, and breath in a unifying
        practice. Fundamentally, the practice of yoga allows us to move through
        the world with more physical and mental ease. Yoga makes use of tools
        such as focused attention, breathwork, and physical postures. When we
        practice the tools of yoga, we are better able to connect with the part
        of us that often goes unexplored - our inner self, our wilderness.

        I offer gentle, vinyasa-style yoga sessions via zoom for anyone seeking
        to begin or deepen a yoga practice. Modifications are offered and props
        are encouraged. A key element of the practice is listening attentively
        to your inner self, following the cues that serve you and disregarding
        the rest. This is your practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoga can be a wonderful addition to your life. It offers rest, healing,
        and community. I invite you to roll out your mat and practice with me!

      <p>Hi, I’m Rachel. Welcome to Northbound Yoga!</p>

      <p>
        Northbound Yoga was formed with one of my favorite places in mind - the
        Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness within the Superior National
        Forest of northern Minnesota. This beautiful wilderness offers moments
        of serenity like nothing you’ve ever experienced. It offers time and
        space away from the hustle and bustle of modern life, a place to
        reconnect with fellow campers and with yourself. It also presents
        challenges and discomforts you might expect from canoeing and portaging
        through the wilderness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find that my own inner wilderness reflects the complexities of a place
        like the Boundary Waters. There is wild beauty in me and there is
        powerful strength. There is sharp pain and intense joy. There is calm
        serenity and there is turbulent anxiety. The practice of yoga has helped
        me observe and accept my inner self with loving-kindness so I can move
        through the world with more stability and ease.

        My personal yoga practice began when I was in highschool. My doctor at
        the time literally prescribed me with “yoga practice” when I complained
        of back pain due to scoliosis. As I started practicing yoga, I found
        myself frustrated that my body did not form the same shapes other yogis
        formed with their bodies. I’ve since discovered acceptance instead of
        frustration in this regard. I may never be able to touch my toes without
        bending my knees in a forward fold (I still bend my knees), but my
        unique movements serve my true self in a way that no other bodies’
        movements ever could. With this discovery came liberation, gratitude,
        and joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my yoga practice developed through the years, I began experiencing
        less physical pain in my back and shoulders (hello desk job!) and I was
        less reactive to the emotional highs and lows of life. I could not deny
        yoga’s positive effect on my life, and that’s why I decided to share
        yoga with others. I started my 200 hr Yoga Teacher Training in 2020 and
        began teaching via zoom that same year. I graduated from The Yoga Center
        Retreat in Minneapolis, MN in Spring of 2022. I will complete an
        additional 300 hr Yoga Teacher Training program in 2023. I hope to be a
        forever-student of yoga and to share this great practice with others.
